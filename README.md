Hi! I’m a frontend developer who loves building web experiences that feel smooth, intuitive, and meaningful—mostly using React.js. For me, frontend isn’t just about code, it’s about creating interfaces that people enjoy using and that actually make their lives a little easier.

I spend most of my time turning ideas and designs into responsive, accessible, and reliable products. I like the challenge of making things look good and work well on any screen. I also enjoy working with teams—designers, backend devs, product folks—and being part of the process from idea to launch.

What got me into frontend development was a mix of curiosity and a desire to build things people interact with directly. I’m always learning, experimenting, and trying to understand how users think and feel. Outside of coding, I’m someone who pays attention to details, likes asking “why?”, and believes technology should be simple, inclusive, and human.
